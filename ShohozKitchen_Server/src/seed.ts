 *   Admin (1) · Products (live + pending moderation)
 *   Customers (10: 6 have ordered) · Orders across the full 11-state lifecycle + 3 payment methods.

 * Idempotent: re-running first wipes any previous seed (anything on the @shohozkitchen.com domain)
 * so it never piles up duplicates. Real (non-seed) accounts are never touched.
